## ML Playground

### About

This is my small summer 2023 where I applied what I learned in 
Purdue's CS 373 (Machine Learning and Data Mining) to data found
on Kaggle.  </br>


### Projects

#### Brain MRI Images

This dataset is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). The 
corresponding file is `brain_mri.py`. 
Here's a picture with metrics of the model on the test set: ![](https://github.com/dhsiehcode/ml_playground/blob/b4586ed839e6f6a7bb087ab79758ba7b7795cfe9/3%20then%204%20components.png)
